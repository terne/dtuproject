####Data


**IBM Debater Argument Search Engine Dataset** from:

*Towards an argumentative content search engine using weak supervision*.Ran Levy, Ben Bogin, Shai Gretz, Ranit Aharonov and Noam Slonim. COLING 2018.

*Unsupervised corpus--wide claim detection*. Ran Levy, Shai Gretz, Benjamin Sznajder, Shay Hummel, Ranit Aharonov and Noam Slonim. 4th Workshop on Argument Mining, EMNLP, 2017.

I have augmented the gold labeled test set by splitting the 2500 samples into train, dev, and test sets. In the tsv files are IDs, labels, the sentences and the topic, respectively. Find the original data at https://www.research.ibm.com/haifa/dept/vst/debating_data.shtml to get the content, which I have excluded, described in readme_test_set.txt (i.e. main concept, query pattern, DNN score and url).
